The Four Basic Principles Of Creating Game Based Learning Programs  >> 

There has been a significant boom in the popularity of game based learning solutions especially for kids and corporate employees. However, not all such courses provide the desired results and in fact turn out to be boring and frustrating for the learners. In order to get the desired results, companies developing such solutions need to understand the learning process and ability of the target audiences in general. In addition, it is important for these companies to follow some basic principles while developing effective learning solutions to meet the diverse training needs of individual users.  

Keeping The Prerequisites In Mind  

Companies offering game based training in Mumbai need to understand that like any other e-learning programs, these courses also need to be base on some prerequisites. This might include prior knowledge about some concepts or the need to have cleared a previous level of the game. If these prerequisites are not fulfilled, it can hamper the learning process of the trainees and even make them feel confused about the topic concept being taught. To avoid any such issues, it is important to provide a proper detail of the prerequisites for the specific game based learning programs.   

Keeping The Learners Motivated

One of the biggest reasons behind the failure of game based learning programs is their inability to retain learner attention for long. For this it is important to create unique scenarios that offer ample learning opportunities without taking away the fun factor. It has been observed that learning solutions that pique the interest of the learners are capable of motivating them more than the ones that offer greater fun and enjoyment.   

Ability To Test And Implement The Concepts Learned 

A game based learning solution proves ineffective if the learners are not able to test their newly acquired knowledge in a real life based scenario. Providing such options within the programs helps in enhancing the confidence of the learners as they are able to test their knowledge in practical situation that they can relate to. Using animated graphics and interactive videos even the most complex problems can be resolved in an easy manner, which in turn proves beneficial in the overall learning process.    

Providing Well Defined Learning Objectives 

Unless the trainees have a clear idea of the learning objectives that are to be achieved at the end of a specific course, they tend to feel lost and disinterested. As such it is important to clearly define the objectives of a specific game based training program right at the beginning. This helps in maintaining the focus and interest of the trainees till end.
